Hope is overcoming nostalgia at night.. Here hope is born, and we die. Sometimes we wish our dreams were true.. And sometimes we wish our reality was a dream. Some sorrows don't need solutions.. They just need the palm of a friend patting you on the shoulder.. To tell you: I feel you. In the middle of the night I love my solitude even though it is dark and cold, awakening my memories and pages that have been damaged. Only those who are more loyal than necessary suffer. Don't put all your dreams in one person.. And don't make the journey of your life the destination of a person you love no matter what his qualities are.. And don't think that the end of things is the end of the world.. The universe is not what your eyes see. There is still a tear, a wound, and a stifled scream inside me.. The pain is still asleep and with a word it wakes up from its sleep.. My apparent calm deceives the calm of a shocked human being. You left me with enough pain for seventy years.. What generosity is this. If you told me sadness is gone.. I find it in front of me.. I have a pain in my heart, stabbed with sadness.. That has never passed through the eyes of orphans. Without feeling.. I find hot tears burning my cheeks.. I close my eyes tightly so that I see nothing but them.. I don't want more tears.. Then I sleep and don't feel anything. My heart tightens when I look around and don't (find you) and I need you but don't (see you) and I die a thousand times when I see your ghost and don't (see you). Give your entire life to a sincere feeling and a heart that contains you.. And don't give a moment of it for the sake of a runaway lover.. Or a heart that abandoned you without a reason. I wrote my love for you on the pages of my eyes.. For everyone who sees me to read it.. For everyone who meets me to know it.. And I drew your picture in my heart.. So that the eyes of others don't glimpse it. I am the one whose branches died.. And my spring dried up.. I am the one whose gardens of love turned.. Into graves for my tears. Absence is not their fault, we are the ones who made a big mistake when we gave them everything. In this time, if you are hurt and tortured, they love you.. and if you love and suffer, they forget you. My eyes cried for the pain of separation.. and my sad heart repeated with burning.. how can the heart forget you.. you who reside in the heart. I am sailing with the world on a boat without an oar.. lost on the palm of time and I do not know where it will throw me. Do not wait for a lover who sold you.. and wait for a new light that can sneak into your sad heart and restore joy to your days and return your heart to its beautiful pulse. Your absence tired me a lot, then I started writing about you in my sleeplessness, then my volume was filled with you, then the weight of my depression exhausted me.. free me from your absence. The refined in their morals are the people who suffer the most in this life.. Indeed, no one knows their language except those who are equal to them in refinement. We love to leave when all the solutions to stay are gone.. We carry our pains on our shoulders with a lowered head and heavy steps. I miss you so much and I couldn't tell you, pride silenced me, my lady. I thought I could light my candle again.. I forgot how to light candles a long time ago.. I thought I could write words of joy, but when I wrote them I felt that something inside me was wounded.. They were with me on the waiting sidewalk telling me stories of the absent.. And after the return of their loved ones, they embraced in front of me and then left and I was left alone mourning my condition. Don't try to search for a dream that let you down.. And try to make the state of brokenness the beginning of a new dream and don't stand too long on the ruins especially if bats have inhabited them and ghosts have found their way.. And search for the sound of a bird sneaking behind the horizon with the light of a new morning. Sometimes some things don't burn you or hurt you, but they teach you that you are good for the thousandth time.. And that you were more than necessary in your intentions. These are the days.. They even deprived me of dreams.. I loved solitude and suffering.. Joys are a veil between me and them.. How long, my heart.. How long will the days hurt me.. And how long will I hide my sorrows.. It hurts to be more honest than they expect and they are more lying than I expected. Calmness is what a person needs most in this time.. The noise of life has become deadly. I wonder about this world that brings us together even though we do not know each other.. And separates us even though our hearts are attached to each other. It is painful that tear that falls while you are silent, falls from the intensity of oppression, pain and need. Regret kills me every time I remember the words I said to a person who does not deserve it. We fail to forget because in reality we do not want to forget despite all the pain that remembrance carries. Do not cry over any relationship in life.. Because the one you cry for does not deserve your tears and the one who deserves your tears.. will never make you cry. When excuses are worse than guilt, pack your pride and leave. It's nice to see something that used to hurt you and now doesn't move you. Pain doesn't need a long talk. Sometimes the tone of voice is half the talk. The hardest thing: When you force yourself to ignore someone who meant the world to you. The absent ones are a painful blow that never stops bleeding. I love sitting by the sea. The sound of its waves is more honest than the conversations of some people. The hardest kind of resistance is when you want to cry but you smile to protect your pride. We live in a time where cunning is called (intelligence) and kindness is called (stupidity). No one feels what I feel, I cry, I get lost, and I need a hug to throw myself into but I don't find one, then I get up hoping that they will feel. Oh eye, don't cry, live in the blessing of forgetfulness. It's a loss that your tears fall on those who don't respect them. Sadness.. is to love someone who never thought of loving you. Trust in your abilities, the bird on the tree is not afraid of the branch breaking because it does not trust the branch, but trusts its wings. Only the sad person understands the eyes of the sad, even if he does not stutter or cry.. The torment of longing is harsh if he becomes silent.. Like a child who understands but does not know how to speak.. How difficult it is to live in confusion.. because of a person one day you see him as a lover and the next day you do not know who he is..
